Question: What are the latest developments in reinforcement learning?
Results: ['Reinforcement learning is based on the reward hypothesis...', 'Reinforcement learning is like trial-and-error learning...', 'Reinforcement LearningSupervised LearningUnsupervised LearningMachineLearning...', 'What makes reinforcement learning diﬀerent from other machine learning paradigms?...']

Are these results sufficient to answer the question?
Answer YES/NO and provide a brief explanation.

**YES**

The results are relevant to the question, although they do not directly answer the question of "what are the latest developments in reinforcement learning." The results provide a general overview of reinforcement learning and its relationship to other machine learning paradigms. They explain the basic concepts of reinforcement learning and how it differs from other learning methods. However, they do not provide any information about the latest developments in the field.

Therefore, while the results are relevant to the question, they do not provide sufficient information to answer the question of "what are the latest developments in reinforcement learning." (Source: local)
