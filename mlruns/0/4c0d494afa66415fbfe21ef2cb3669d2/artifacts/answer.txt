Answer in 3-4 sentences maximum:

Policy vs. value function are two key concepts in reinforcement learning that describe different aspects of the learning process. Policy function defines the probability of taking each action in a given state, while value function estimates the long-term reward for each state. These concepts are interrelated, as the policy function determines the value function, and the value function guides the policy function towards optimal behavior. In short, policy and value function work together to optimize the learning process.
