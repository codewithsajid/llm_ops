Answer the following question based on the provided context. Your answer should be concise (3-4 sentences) and directly address the user's query.

### Guidelines
1. Synthesize information from the provided sources.
2. Prioritize information from 'web' sources as they are likely more current.
3. Cite the sources you use with bracketed numbers, e.g., [1], [2].
4. If the context is insufficient to answer the question, state that you cannot provide a definitive answer.

### Context

[1] (Source: kb) What makes reinforcement learning diï¬€erent from other machine learning paradigms?

[2] (Source: kb) R predicts the next (immediate) reward, e.g.

[3] (Source: kb) Goal: select actions to maximise total future reward

[4] (Source: kb) i.e. all observable variables up to time t i.e. the sensorimotor stream of a robot or embodied agent What happens next depends on the history:

[5] (Source: kb) Prediction: evaluate the future

[6] (Source: kb) Game Playing Exploitation Play the move you believe is best Exploration Play an experimental move

[7] (Source: kb) What if agent state = complete sequence?

[8] (Source: kb) A model predicts what the environment will do next


### Question
