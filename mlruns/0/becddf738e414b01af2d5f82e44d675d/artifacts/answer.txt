### Final answer:

The latest developments in RL include the emergence of new algorithms that are more efficient at learning from large amounts of data, as well as the development of new techniques for improving the performance of RL agents in complex environments. One notable development is the use of deep learning techniques to learn policy parameters from large datasets [1]. Another development is the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms to learn policies that can generalize well to new tasks [2].
