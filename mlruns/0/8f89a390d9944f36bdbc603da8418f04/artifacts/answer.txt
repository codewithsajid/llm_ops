### Final answer:
The latest developments in RL include advancements in policy optimization techniques, such as actor-critic methods, and the development of new algorithms for learning from demonstrations [1]. Additionally, there has been progress in applying RL to various domains, including robotics, self-driving cars, and game playing [2].

While I do not have access to the most up-to-date information, I believe that these are the latest developments in the field of RL.
