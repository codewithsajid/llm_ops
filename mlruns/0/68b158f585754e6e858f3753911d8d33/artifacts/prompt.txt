### Guidelines
1. Synthesize information from the provided sources.
2. Prioritize information from 'web' sources as they are likely more current.
3. Cite the sources you use with bracketed numbers, e.g., [1], [2].
4. If the context is insufficient to answer the question, state that you cannot provide a definitive answer.

### Context

[1] (Source: kb) Reinforcement learning is based on the reward hypothesis

[2] (Source: kb) Reinforcement learning is like trial-and-error learning
