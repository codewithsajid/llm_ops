Question: Explain policy vs value function.
Results: ['Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment', 'What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy?', 'Value function is a prediction of future reward', 'It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]']
Are these results sufficient to answer the question completely? Answer YES or NO with brief explanation.

YES/NO

**Explanation:**

The results are partially relevant to the question. They explain the policy and value function concepts, but they do not answer the question of how they differ. The results mention the value function as a prediction of future reward and its relationship to the agent's representation of the environment, but they do not explain the policy function in relation to the value function. Therefore, the results are not sufficient to answer the question completely. (Source: local)


Context from knowledge base and web:

[1] Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment 

[2] What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy? 

[3] Value function is a prediction of future reward 

[4] It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]
