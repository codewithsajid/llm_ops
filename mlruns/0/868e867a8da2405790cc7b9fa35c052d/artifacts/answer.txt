Sure, here is an explanation of the value function:

The value function is a function that maps each state of the environment to a real number, representing the long-term expected return for that state. [1]

The value function is used to guide the learning process by estimating the optimal policy. [2]

The value function is a key concept in reinforcement learning and is essential for solving many problems. [3]

Therefore, the value function is a fundamental component of reinforcement learning algorithms. [4]
