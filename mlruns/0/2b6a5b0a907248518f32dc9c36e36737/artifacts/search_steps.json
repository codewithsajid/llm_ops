What is the optimal policy?', 'Value function is a prediction of future reward', 'It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = \u03c0(s) Stochastic policy: \u03c0(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]']\nAre these results sufficient to answer the question completely? Answer YES or NO with brief explanation.\n\nYES\n\nThe results are sufficient to answer the question completely because they explain both the policy and value function concepts in relation to the environment model. The text describes the policy as the agent's behaviour function, which maps states to actions, and the value function as a prediction of future reward, also mapping states to values. The results also mention the optimal value function and policy, highlighting the connection between the two. However, they do not provide examples or specific details about the policy and value functions, which could be helpful for a more complete understanding.",
