Question: Explain policy vs value function.
Results: ['Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment', 'What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy?', 'Value function is a prediction of future reward', 'It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]']
Are these results sufficient to answer the question completely? Answer YES or NO with brief explanation.

YES

The results are sufficient to answer the question completely because they explain both the policy and value function concepts in relation to the environment model. The text describes the policy as the agent's behaviour function, which maps states to actions, and the value function as a prediction of future reward, also mapping states to values. The results also mention the optimal value function and policy, highlighting the connection between the two. However, they do not provide examples or specific details about the policy and value functions, which could be helpful for a more complete understanding. (Source: local)


Context from knowledge base and web:

[1] Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment 

[2] What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy? 

[3] Value function is a prediction of future reward 

[4] It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]
