The latest developments in RL include offline reinforcement learning, meta-reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and the combination of model-based and model-free methods. These techniques address real-world constraints and complexities, such as safety-critical industries and complex, multi-step processes. Additionally, the RL community is actively working on improving sample efficiency, robustness, and adaptability.
