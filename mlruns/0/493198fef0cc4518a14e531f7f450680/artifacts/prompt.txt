### Task
Answer the following question based on the provided context. Your answer should be concise (3-4 sentences) and directly address the user's query.

### Guidelines
1. Synthesize information from the provided sources.
2. Prioritize information from 'web' sources as they are likely more current.
3. Cite the sources you use with bracketed numbers, e.g., [1], [2].
4. If the context is insufficient to answer the question, state that you cannot provide a definitive answer.

### Context

[1] (Source: kb) What makes reinforcement learning diﬀerent from other machine learning paradigms?

[2] (Source: kb) Goal: select actions to maximise total future reward

[3] (Source: kb) A model of the environment is known The agent performs computations with its model (without any external interaction) The agent improves its policy a.k.a. deliberation, reasoning, introspection, pondering, thought, search

[4] (Source: kb) Prediction: evaluate the future

[5] (Source: kb) Game Playing Exploitation Play the move you believe is best Exploration Play an experimental move

[6] (Source: kb) It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]

[7] (Source: kb) is

[8] (Source: kb) i.e. whatever data the environment uses to pick the next observation/reward
