### Final answer:
The latest developments in reinforcement learning include advancements in policy optimization algorithms, such as actor-critic networks, and improvements in data collection techniques, such as meta-learning and domain randomization. Additionally, there has been progress in the development of new algorithms for addressing complex tasks, such as learning to play video games and control robots. [1]

Although I have access to a vast amount of information, I do not have the ability to access the latest information on a regular basis, therefore I cannot provide the most up-to-date information.
