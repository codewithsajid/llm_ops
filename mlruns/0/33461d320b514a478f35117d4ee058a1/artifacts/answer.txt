Context from knowledge base and web:

[1] Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment 

[2] What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy? 

[3] Value function is a prediction of future reward 

[4] It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s] 


Question: Explain policy vs value function.

Please provide:
1. A clear definition of key concepts
2. How these concepts relate to each other
3. A brief example if relevant
4. Citations to materials [1], [2] etc.

Answer in 3-4 sentences maximum:

**Key Concepts:**

* **Policy:** Agent's behaviour function, determining the best action to take in each state.
* **Value Function:** Predicts future reward for a given state or action.

**Relationship:**

The value function is closely related to the policy. The optimal policy is the policy that maximizes the value function.

**Example:**

In a game of chess, the policy might be the move that leads to the best position, while the value function would predict the future value of that position.

**Citations:**

[1] Policy, Agent's Behaviour Function
[2] Optimal Value Function and Policy

**Additional Notes:**

The value function is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning and is used to guide the learning process.
