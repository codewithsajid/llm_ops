Context from knowledge base and web:

[1] What makes reinforcement learning diï¬€erent from other machine learning paradigms? 

[2] An RL agent may include one or more of these components: 

[3] i.e. all observable variables up to time t i.e. the sensorimotor stream of a robot or embodied agent What happens next depends on the history: 

[4] What if agent state = complete sequence? 


Question: What are the latest developments in RL?

Please provide:
1. A clear definition of key concepts
2. How these concepts relate to each other
3. A brief example if relevant
4. Citations to materials [1], [2] etc.

Answer in 3-4 sentences maximum:

The latest developments in reinforcement learning include the incorporation of deep learning techniques, enabling agents to learn complex policies from large amounts of data. These techniques include policy gradient methods and actor-critic algorithms. Additionally, there has been progress in developing algorithms for learning from demonstrations, allowing agents to learn from human experts.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A learning paradigm that involves an agent interacting with an environment to learn optimal policies.
- **Sensorimotor Stream**: The sequence of observable variables up to time t.
- **Agent State**: The complete sequence of all observable variables.

**Relationships:**

- RL agents include sensorimotor streams and agent states.
- The history of an agent's sensorimotor stream determines its future actions.
- If the agent state is complete, its future actions are determined by the history of its sensorimotor stream.

**Example:**

A robot learning to navigate a maze. The sensorimotor stream includes the robot's position and orientation in the maze, as well as the locations of the walls. The agent state includes all of the sensorimotor stream up to the current time. If the agent state is complete, its future actions are determined by the history of its
