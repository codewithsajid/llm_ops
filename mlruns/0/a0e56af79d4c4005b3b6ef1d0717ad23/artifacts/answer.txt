**Answer:**

Reinforcement learning (RL) is distinct from other machine learning paradigms due to its emphasis on learning through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. Unlike other learning methods that typically rely on explicit instructions or large amounts of labeled data, RL agents learn through their own actions and the resulting feedback from the environment. This iterative process involves observing variables up to a particular time, taking actions, and adjusting future behavior based on the outcomes. Recent advancements in RL include improved algorithms for learning complex policies, handling continuous actions, and incorporating domain knowledge into the learning process.
