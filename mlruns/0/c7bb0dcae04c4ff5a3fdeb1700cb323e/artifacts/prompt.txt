[3] (Source: web) Boston Dynamics and the Robotics & AI Institute (formerly The AI Institute) have formed a partnership to advance humanoid robots through reinforcement learning.
Together, the two organizations will establish a shared reinforcement learning training pipeline for the new electric Atlas robot to build dynamic and generalizable mobile manipulation behavior.
The work, which kicked off this month, brings together two of the industry’s leading research teams to advance robot technology and to produce new capabilities on Atlas.
The partnership expands upon previous collaborations between Boston Dynamics and the Robotics & AI Institute (RAI Institute), including joint development work on Spot’s Reinforcement Learning Researcher Kit.
Released last year, the kit trains unique behavior and modes of locomotion on the quadruped, and was used to achieve record running speeds of 11.5 mph (5.2 m/s).
This collaboration builds upon that work, with a new focus on humanoid robots. The project has several objectives:
- Develop sim-to-real for mobility: Despite advances in fast parallel simulators and sophisticated policy optimization techniques, transferring simulation results to real robotic hardware remains one of the most challenging aspects of applying reinforcement learning in robotics. To bridge the sim-to-reality gap, the teams will collaborate to train policies that generate a variety of agile behavior on physical hardware to achieve novel, robust and practical locomotion behavior.
- Improve whole body loco-manipulation: A robot’s capability to manipulate objects and fixtures, such as doors and levers, in conjunction with locomotion would significantly enhance its utility. The team will explore developing new policies to improve robustness in these scenarios.
- Explore full-body contact strategies: This work will explore high-performance, whole-body locomotion and tasks that require full-body contact strategies, such as dynamic running and full-body manipulation of heavy objects,
