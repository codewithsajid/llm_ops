### Final answer:

The latest developments in reinforcement learning include the integration of deep learning techniques, which have led to significant improvements in performance and the development of new algorithms for learning from policy and value functions. Additionally, there has been progress in the areas of continuous control, multi-agent learning, and transfer learning. [1]

While I have access to a vast amount of information, I do not have the ability to provide information on the latest developments in reinforcement learning beyond what is included in the provided text. Therefore, I cannot answer the question fully.
