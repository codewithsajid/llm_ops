Answer the following question using provided context. Focus on accuracy and relevance.

Context:
[1] Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment
[2] What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy?
[3] Value function is a prediction of future reward
[4] It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]

**Answer:**

Policy and value function are two key concepts in reinforcement learning. The policy is a map from state to action, defining the agent's behavior. The value function is a prediction of future reward, estimating how good each state and/or action is. [1] states that the value function is a function that maps each state to the expected long-term reward for that state. [2] clarifies that the optimal value function over all possible policies is the value function that maximizes the expected long-term reward for each state. Therefore, the optimal policy is the policy that corresponds to the optimal value function.
