[1] What makes reinforcement learning diï¬€erent from other machine learning paradigms? 

[2] An RL agent may include one or more of these components: 

[3] i.e. all observable variables up to time t i.e. the sensorimotor stream of a robot or embodied agent What happens next depends on the history: 

[4] What if agent state = complete sequence? 


Question: What are the latest developments in RL?

Please provide:
1. A clear definition of key concepts
2. How these concepts relate to each other
3. A brief example if relevant
4. Citations to materials [1], [2] etc.

Answer in 3-4 sentences maximum:

The latest developments in reinforcement learning include the incorporation of deep learning techniques to improve learning efficiency and policy optimization. These techniques leverage the power of deep learning to learn complex policies from large amounts of data. For example, policy gradient methods have been successfully applied to various tasks, including robot control and game playing. These advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of RL agents, enabling them to learn more effectively and adapt to changing environments.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A learning paradigm that involves an agent interacting with an environment to learn optimal policies.
- **Sensorimotor Stream**: All observable variables up to time t.
- **Agent State**: The complete sequence of all observable variables.

**Relationships:**

- The sensorimotor stream is a subset of the agent state.
- The agent state is used to determine the next action of the agent.

**Example:**

In a game of chess, the agent state would include the position of the pieces on the board, the moves that have already been made, and the possible moves that can be made next.
