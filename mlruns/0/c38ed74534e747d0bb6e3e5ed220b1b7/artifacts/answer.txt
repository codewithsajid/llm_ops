The latest developments in RL include the use of deep learning techniques for policy optimization and value function estimation [1]. Additionally, there has been progress in developing algorithms for learning from demonstrations, which allows agents to learn from human experts [2]. These advancements have made RL a powerful tool for solving a wide range of complex problems.
