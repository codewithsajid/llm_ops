Answer the following question using provided context. Focus on accuracy and relevance.

Context:
[1] Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment
[2] What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy?
[3] Value function is a prediction of future reward
[4] It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]

**Answer:**

Policy and value function are two key concepts in reinforcement learning. Policy is a map from state to action, specifying the agent's behaviour. Value function is a prediction of future reward, estimating how good each state and/or action is. According to [1] and [2], the value function is a function that assigns a value to each state and action, while the policy is a function that selects the optimal action for each state. Therefore, the optimal value function over all possible policies is the function that maximizes the expected future reward for each state. The optimal policy is the policy that corresponds to the optimal value function.
