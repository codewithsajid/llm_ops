The latest developments in RL include the use of deep learning techniques to improve learning algorithms, as well as the development of new algorithms for tackling complex tasks. One notable development is the use of deep Q-learning to learn policies that outperform traditional RL algorithms. Additionally, the development of new algorithms for learning from demonstrations has enabled RL to be applied to a wider range of tasks. [1, 2]
