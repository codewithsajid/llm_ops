### Task
Answer the following question based on the provided context. Your answer should be concise (3–4 sentences), use only information present in the context, and cite every fact with [n], where n is the snippet index.

### Context

[1] (Source: kb) Value function is a prediction of future reward

[2] (Source: kb) What is the optimal value function over all possible policies? What is the optimal policy?

[3] (Source: kb) Policy: agent’s behaviour function Value function: how good is each state and/or action Model: agent’s representation of the environment

[4] (Source: kb) It is a map from state to action, e.g. Deterministic policy: a = π(s) Stochastic policy: π(a|s) = P[At = a|St = s]

[5] (Source: kb) What is the value function for the uniform random policy?

[6] (Source: kb) Formally, this is a Markov decision process (MDP)

[7] (Source: kb) It may be better to sacriﬁce immediate reward to gain more long-term reward Examples:

[8] (Source: kb) vπ(s) = Eπ
